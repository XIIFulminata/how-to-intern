# Tips for Non-CS STEM Backgrounds
The two biggest things are getting noticed for the interview, and actually performing.

## Getting an interview (resume / application tips):
* If you did any internships, research at school, or worked in your previous STEM focus area include them, but try refocus around anything you might have done that was programming related
* CS projects are good to include if you have them. You don't have to be super active on github, but you should have some programming challenges to talk about in an interview. Hackathons which you'd now qualify for, are a good way to bang out quick projects if you like working with people, but I would recommend working on something on your own too, so you can better speak to it.
* Skills: kinda hard to pinpoint here, but I listed any languages I felt comfortable using. The rule of thumb is to not list anything you wouldn't want to be asked about
* If you're doing well on the above and not getting feedback, there's probably a resume issue, so get it reviewed by someone
* Apply early. I started in September for following summer. It's not necessary, but some companies complete their recruiting cycle as early as August
* Get referrals if you can. If the person is in your network, they're often happy to help since most companies give bonuses for referrals.

## Interviewing:
* You need to have a firm grasp of data structures and algorithms, but you don't need to have taken the class. I personally skimmed this [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews/), worked through a lot of [CTCI](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850), and did leetcode easy and medium questions. Again, anything works, but you should know what basic data structures are available to you and when they're applicable.
* Optimize for what a reasonable employer would ask. Most aren't asking LC hard questions, system design, bit manipulation, etc. for internships, so focus on work that is applicable at 80% of the places you want to apply
* Interview in python. It makes everything a lot cleaner and more manageable. 


## General
* Job posting requirements are a wishlist, not an absolute so don't get scared off by them. Applications are more a volume game than anything
* It's a lot easier to get roles after your first, even if your first isn't somewhere particularly well known. There are also some really great program out there at places that aren't Google, FB, etc. Definitely try for those places, but don't ignore others.
* Try for apprenticeships as well. Their model is more set up for bootcamp grads and self taught people, but it's essentially the same.

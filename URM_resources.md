* [CODE 2040](http://www.code2040.org/) is a fellowship that links you to potential employers for **summer internships**. You go through their application process, then you get fed into their employer portal where you can more directly contact and be contacted by companies that are looking to hire more diverse candidates. They also provide workshops and activities throughout the summer to help your career development.
* [GEM](http://www.gemfellowship.org/about-gem/gem-events-and-conferences/grad-lab/) is a fellowship that can can fund your if you want to go to **grad school** in a STEM field that you have (or will get) and undergrad degree for. Some funding comes from them, and and some from employers if you find a match. The employers will also take you on for internships and FTE. 
* [The Consortium](https://cgsm.org/) is similar to GEM if you want an MBA instead.

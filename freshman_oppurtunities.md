## Internships General
* Unless specifically stated, you have a shot at any internship, the above programs just have a more restrictive applicant pool. Despite not having a specific "freshman internship" role, companies like GE will hire rising sophomores in the hopes of bringing them back for a few rotations. 
* You can any job aggregator (linkedin, glassdoor, google, etc.) or just go to the company's specific appllication, but you should probably keep track of the roles you apply for in case you want to follow up. I've found [huntr](https://huntr.co/) and it's [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/huntr-job-search-tracker/mihdfbecejheednfigjpdacgeilhlmnf) to be really helpful for doing this. 
* It's pretty standard to get ghosted, so apply to A LOT of internships (50+ is not uncommon). Treat it like a college application and apply for some "reach" internships, ones you look like a great fit for, and some "safety" ones that you might not be to thrilled about (but will be better than nothing).
* To the above point, it's probably not worth following up unless you've been through and interview already, but it can't really hurt as long as you're polite about it.
* Get referrals where you can, as you can often skip the screening phase and go straight into interivews. This is probably a lot harder as a freshman/sophomore, and by no means necessary, but do it if you can.

## Internships General
* Unless specifically stated, you have a shot at any internship, the above programs just have a more restrictive applicant pool. Despite not having a specific "freshman internship" role, companies like GE will hire rising sophomores in the hopes of bringing them back for a few rotations. 
* You can any job aggregator (linkedin, glassdoor, google, etc.) or just go to the company's specific appllication, but you should probably keep track of the roles you apply for in case you want to follow up. I've found [huntr](https://huntr.co/) and it's [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/huntr-job-search-tracker/mihdfbecejheednfigjpdacgeilhlmnf) to be really helpful for doing this. 
* It's pretty standard to get ghosted, so apply to A LOT of internships (50+ is not uncommon). Treat it like a college application and apply for some "reach" internships, ones you look like a great fit for, and some "safety" ones that you might not be to thrilled about (but will be better than nothing).
* To the above point, it's probably not worth following up unless you've been through and interview already, but it can't really hurt as long as you're polite about it.
* Get referrals where you can, as you can often skip the screening phase and go straight into interivews. This is probably a lot harder as a freshman/sophomore, and by no means necessary, but do it if you can.


## REU's (Research Experience for Undergraduates)
From nsf.gov:
> NSF funds a large number of research opportunities for undergraduate students through its REU Sites program. An REU Site consists of a group of ten or so undergraduates who work in the research programs of the host institution. Each student is associated with a specific research project, where he/she works closely with the faculty and other researchers. Students are granted stipends and, in many cases, assistance with housing and travel. Undergraduate students supported with NSF funds must be citizens or permanent residents of the United States or its possessions. An REU Site may be at either a US or foreign location.

TL;DR - You can do research at institutions around the US and even internationally in several subject areas. Check out the full list of subject areas [here](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp) or just those focused on [computer science and engineering](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5049).

## Google Summer of Code (or any Open Source Contributions)
From summerofcode.withgoogle.com:
> Spend your summer break writing code and learning about open source development while earning a stipend! Accepted students work with a mentor and become a part of the open source community. Many become lifetime open source developers!

TL;DR - You get a mentor, a project, and a stipend. [Check it out](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). If you don't get in, but like the idea of working on something practical, look into open source tools you might already use ([runelite](https://github.com/runelite), [RES](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite), or [tachiyomi](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi)), and see if you can get involved. 

## Personal Project / (Free) Udacity Course
* Half of the battle for your first job is getting noticed for interviews. Without experience, personal projects go a long way for demonstrating interest and ability. This can be a good chance to deep dive on some area that you already have an interest in or explore more things.
* Some people will reccomend making a personal website. This is probably pretty useless if you don't have projects to display, so consider whether it's worth the time.
* Running low on ideas? Check out this [list](https://github.com/karan/Projects). There's nothing wrong with doing a cookie cutter project to learn something, but all your projects shouldn't be like that. Following instructions can be a good way to learn but doesn't demonstrate much.
